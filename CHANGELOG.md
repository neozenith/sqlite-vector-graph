## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-02-16

### Bug Fixes
- Fix CI: use pysqlite3-binary for extension loading, install uv

The actions/setup-python@v5 Python 3.13 builds lack
PY_SQLITE_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION, so enable_load_extension() is
unavailable. Use pysqlite3-binary as a drop-in replacement in CI.
Also install uv via astral-sh/setup-uv@v4 for package install tests,
and fix the persistence test's extension path to use build/muninn.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>- Fix CI: pysqlite3 fallback for ARM64/macOS, add build/ to npm binary search

pysqlite3-binary only publishes wheels for Linux x86_64. Fall back to
pysqlite3 (source compile) on ARM64 and macOS where no binary wheel
exists.

Also add build/ directory to getLoadablePath() search order since
make all outputs to build/muninn.{so,dylib,dll}, not the repo root.
